Availity's Fullstack Homework Assignment 

Problem # 6.

The file with the main method is the CSVFileReader.java.  Two Class files are needed that support this program.  The first Class is InsuranceUser.java.  This Class contains the fields and methods to manage each insurance record.  It has the standard toString method, but it was overridden to fit the data fields.  It has an implementation of the compareTo method specific for this project.  The second Class file was made necessary to instantiate each file streaming connection to be able to iterate through the records to help determine which record was going into which file.  The name of that class is DataOutputStreamToMultipleFiles.  There might be other solutions for that, but after failing with other solutions, this was the only one that worked for me.  Everything that I had done for labs or homework before only required one file connection for input or output.  As such, I struggled to come up with a solution to instantiate individual file connections for each loop under each Insurance Company.  One thing that failed after I thought that was going to work for sure was instantiating connection files and placed them into an ArrayList<DataOutputStren> type, but I kept getting error messages and gave up on that path.  It was then that I decided to create the class DataOutputStreamToMultipleFiles.   That way I could instantiate objects of type DataOutputStreamToMultipleFiles, which included a unique connection file that I could get with a getter method for each outer loop and that worked.  I don't know what else could have worked... maybe separate threads?  I'll stick with my solution for now.          

A HashSet<String> data structure, which rejects duplicates, was created to capture each unique Insurance Company name.  There might also be other solutions for that, but after failing with other solutions, this was the only one that worked for me.    

Some assumptions were made.  After the initial line input was split by commas (","), and because the problem required that the contents of each file needed to be sorted by "last and first name", the field with "first and and Last Name" had to be split assuming there was only one space (" ") in between them and there are no customers with more than one first name and more than one last name.  For instance, my full name is Angel Javier Martinez-Perez.  It can get complicated so I assumed that this is an exercise that does not take those things into account.  After splitting those files, a temporaty one line string was recreated to be able to sort them while protecting the integrity of the data.  A Collections.sort method was used.  After the data is sorted once, it should remain sorted all the way to the respective files.  That recreated string was then deconstructed into the separate fields.  First and last name was not brought back together because it was assume that Availity wanted them separated.  Otherwise, why sort by last name, right?    

An object of type InsuranceUser was instantiated for each record.  In fact, two ArrayLists<InsuranceUser> were created.  One was needed to hold all the records and the other to "delete" or remove the records according to Problem 6 requirements.  At the end, the list with the removed records was compared to the array of strings that was created from the HashSet<String> to be able to know which record was heading to which file based on matching Insurance Company names in a nested for loop.  

The assignment does not specify which type of files to create at the end.  Is it a .txt file?  A .dat file? Other .csv files?  Was it supposed to stream the objects (namely the instantiated InsuranceUsers?) or the data as Strings again?  If they needed to be sorted by "first and last" name, I assumed that 5 data fields were expected, and not the original 4.  The assumption was made that Availity wanted separate .csv files.  Therefore, .csv files were created.    

During the whole proces I had to create my own fake/dummy data files to test my program during different stages.
